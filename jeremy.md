# Hi, I'm Jeremy! ðŸ‘‹

####I like to write software.

I particularly like to remove software. And if you want to understand my thoughts and feelings, you can pretty much take these two ideas and create conjectures about other things.  For example, does Jeremy like meetings? Only if they get the clarity needed to write software.  Does Jeremy like learning? Yes! Because then I have more tools to help the client and the team! Also, I also like other thingsâ€”I like to play chess, swing dance, and play video games (don't get me started).

I teach dance at Uptown Swing in Minneapolis weekly on Wednesday nights, so Thursday morning can be a bit tough for me.

####I work in a slightly odd way
You may find me floating around aimlessly, I'm usually working on some kind of problem whether it be a chess puzzle or a software puzzle.  Oddly, I've found that I solve most of my problems while walking, that's when I usually think of something.

####Don't be afraid to inturrupt
Generally if I'm at my computer I prefer to talk via text, though I'm pretty open to talking, unless there's a deadline I'm trying to hit.  You generally won't be able to find me if I am very busy.

#### I'm always ok with a "I don't know" answer.
I've found that starting with "I don't know" is a great place to start, and a very, very bad place to end.  I'm particularly inspired by Julia Evans: https://jvns.ca/blog/so-you-want-to-be-a-wizard/


#### I'm never ok with stalling.
Consulting, has really been my M.O. since I've started in the industry, though I'm learning new consultant type things at Magenic. (I like that.)  While working with many stakeholders is seemingly very common, I've found the most difficult things in my carreer have had less to do with technology and more to do with ego.  If you can help me both keep my ego in check, and keep your ego in check I think we'll be in a very good stead.

#### I don't believe that it's a good idea to hide behind ceremony.
I've been through a few different jobs where people aren't willing to learn, and couch that in professionalism.  By in large, I like getting things done, and if that means I need to shave yaks for the rest of my careerâ€”so be it.
